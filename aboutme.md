# About Me

I am a data-driven and detail-oriented Business Intelligence Manager with over 4 years of experience in data analysis, reporting, and visualization. I have a strong foundation in tools like Power BI, Excel, MySQL, and Python for creating actionable insights that drive strategic decisions.

Currently, I lead business intelligence efforts at Micnous Service Nigeria Ltd, where I design interactive dashboards, conduct risk assessments, and implement KPI-driven performance monitoring for multi-million naira projects.

I am passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems across health, infrastructure, and development sectors. To strengthen this capability, I am pursuing an MSc in Data Science at the University of South Wales, focusing on machine learning, predictive analytics, and statistical modeling.
